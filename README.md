## Getting Started
___

### Adding Flourish to your project

In your project's `package.json` file, add the latest version of the Flourish React Native SDK to your dependencies.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "flourish-sdk-react-native": "*.*.*"
}
```
or install directly from the terminal using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install flourish-sdk-react-native
```

```sh
yarn add flourish-sdk-react-native
```

### SDK internal requirements

To use this SDK, you will need these elements:

- uuid: a unique identifier that will be provided by Flourish
- secret: a string that represents a key, also provided by Flourish
- customerCode: a string that represents your identifier
- language: a string that represents which language will be used (en, es, pt)

This plugin can be run in two different environments:

- staging: In this environment, you can test the functionality without impacting any real data
- production: this environment is for running the app with real data
<br>
<br>

### About the SDK

The integration with us works as follows: the client authenticates themselves in our backend,
and we return an access token that allows them to load our webview. Therefore,
the SDK serves to encapsulate and help in loading this webview.

### Using the SDK
___

### 1 - Initialization

##<span style="color:red;">IMPORTANT‚ùó</span>

<div style="border: 1px solid grey; padding: 10px;">

**For the flow to work correctly and for us to have the correct metrics to show our value, it is extremely important to initialize our SDK when opening your App, for example at startup or on the home screen. The most important thing is that it is not initialized at the same time as opening our module.**

</div>

___

First and foremost, it is necessary to initialize the SDK by providing the variables: `uuid`, `secret`, `env`, `language`, `customerCode`, and optionally `trackingId`.

```javascript
import { initialize } from 'flourish-sdk-react-native';

const initialize = async () => {
  await initialize({
    uuid: 'HERE_YOU_WILL_USE_YOUR_PARTNER_ID',
    secret: 'HERE_YOU_WILL_USE_YOUR_SECRET',
    environment: 'staging', // or 'production'
    language: 'en', // 'en', 'es', or 'pt'
    customerCode: 'HERE_YOU_WILL_USE_YOUR_CUSTOMER_CODE',
    trackingId: 'HERE_YOU_WILL_USE_YOUR_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY_THIS_IS_NOT_REQUIRED'
  });
};
```

The `trackingId` variable is used if you want to pass your Google Analytics key to be able to monitor the use of our platform by your users.

### 2 - Open Flourish module

Finally, you can use the Flourish component in your screen:

```javascript
import { Flourish } from 'flourish-sdk-react-native';

const YourScreen = () => {
  return <Flourish />;
};
```

## EVENTS
___

### Listen to generic events

```javascript
const YourScreen = () => {
  const onGenericEvent = (data) => {
    console.log('Event received:', data);
  };

  return <Flourish genericEventCallback={onGenericEvent} />;
};
```

### Events to listen
